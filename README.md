# AgentX - Autonomous Website Maintenance with AI

## Introduction
AgentX is a cross-platform desktop application that automates website maintenance tasks using Google's Gemini LLM and a custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Developed for the Agent-X hackathon, this tool ensures accurate, up-to-date, and optimized websites through autonomous content updates, SEO optimization, error fixing, content generation, and performance monitoring.

## Project Goals and Objectives
- **Automate website maintenance** with minimal human intervention.
- **Integrate Google's Gemini LLM** for context-aware content handling.
- **Enhance SEO and fix errors** to improve website visibility and accuracy.
- **Deliver a user-friendly application** suitable for technical and non-technical users.
- **Ensure scalability** for large-scale website maintenance.

## Technical Architecture
AgentX utilizes a multi-layered architecture for efficient task execution:

### User Interface
- **Next.js (React)**: For a dynamic and responsive interface.
- **Mantine UI**: For a polished, user-friendly experience.

### Backend 
- **Tauri (Rust)**: Ensures cross-platform compatibility and security.
- **Rust**: For fast and efficient data processing.
- **Python**: For specialized website analysis tasks.

### AI Engine
- **Google's Gemini LLM**: For content generation, SEO, and error analysis.
- **Custom RAG Pipeline**: Enables context retrieval and factual grounding.

### Data Management
- **Local Vector Database**: For knowledge retrieval and rapid querying.
- **Web Crawling**: For automated data collection and analysis.

## System Components
1. **LLM Integration Layer**: Manages API communication and prompt parsing.
2. **RAG Pipeline**: Handles content retrieval and augments LLM prompts.
3. **Website Analysis Engine**: Crawls and analyzes website structure and content.
4. **Task Execution System**: Automates content updates, SEO tasks, and error correction.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Autonomous Content Updates
- Detects and updates outdated content.
- Ensures accuracy and formatting consistency.

### 2. SEO Optimization
- Suggests keyword optimizations and heading improvements.
- Generates SEO-friendly metadata and alt-text.

### 3. Error Fixing
- Identifies and repairs broken links and formatting issues.
- Provides a change log for verification and rollback.

### 4. Content Generation

- Produces high-quality, human-like text.

### 5. Performance Monitoring
- Analyzes Core Web Vitals and website performance.
- Recommends optimizations and tracks improvements.

## Innovation and Technical Highlights
- **Hybrid RAG Architecture**: Combines semantic and keyword-based retrieval.
- **Autonomous Decision Loop**: Validates and self-checks changes.
- **Content Integrity Verification**: Ensures factual accuracy through external validation.
- **Tauri Framework**: Optimized for cross-platform desktop deployment.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base**: Allows users to define trusted content sources.

## User Experience
- Guided workflows for automated tasks.
- Visual issue tracking and comparison views.
- Interactive approval of changes.
- Comprehensive logs for auditing and monitoring.

## Testing and Evaluation
- **Unit Testing**: For individual system components.
- **Integration Testing**: For UI and backend interactions.
